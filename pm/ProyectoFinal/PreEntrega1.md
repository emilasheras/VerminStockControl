# ðŸš€ PreEntrega 1 - Proyecto Final

## ðŸ“ƒ Tasks
- [ ] Develop a server using Node.js and Express.js that listens on port 8080 and includes two groups of routes: `/products` and `/carts`. Implement these endpoints using Express's router.
  - Products management (`/api/products/`):
    - [x] On the root route (`/`) with GET, list all products in the database (including support for a `?limit` query parameter as from the previous challenge).
    - [x] On `/:pid` with GET, fetch only the product with the provided id.
    - [x] On the root route (`/`) with POST, add a new product with the following fields:
      - id: Autogenerated Number or String (IDs should never repeat).
      - title: String.
      - description: String.
      - code: String.
      - price: Number.
      - status: Boolean (true by default).
      - stock: Number.
      - category: String.
      - thumbnails: Array of Strings containing paths to images related to the product.
      - Note: All fields are mandatory except for thumbnails.
    - [x] On `/:pid` with PUT, update the product with fields sent in the body. The id must not be updated or deleted.
    - [x] On `/:pid` with DELETE, remove the product with the specified pid.
  - Carts management (`/api/carts/`):
    - [x] On the root route (`/`) with POST, create a new cart with the following structure:
      - id: Autogenerated Number or String (ensure ids are unique and autogenerated).
      - products: Array containing objects that represent each product.
    - [x] On `/:cid` with GET, list the products belonging to the cart with the provided cid parameter.
    - [x] On `/:cid/product/:pid` with POST, add a product to the `products` array of the selected cart in the following format:
      - product: Should only contain the product id.
      - quantity: Number of copies of the product. Add products one at a time, and if a product already exists in the cart, increase its `quantity` field.
- [x] Implement data persistence using the file system, with `products.json` and `carts.json` files supporting the information.
- [x] No visual implementation is required; all workflow can be conducted through Postman or the client of your choice.
